How to Build
=====================

## Dependencies
This app was created using Enact framework.
The following tools and libraries are required to build app:

```
* Node
* NPM
* enact-cli
```

Noticing some intermittent errors depending on your node/npm version.
We've seen it work with node 4.4.7 and npm 2.15.8 and node 6.5.0 and npm 3.10.3.

## Building

Acquire the Source
Download the app source code from a this repository.

Install the Dependencies

Navigate to the app's root directory (the base directory with the package.json). From there, you can use one of the documented techniques for reusing node module dependencies, or you can install the dependencies the basic way:

```
    $ npm install
```

Available Commands
-----------------------

Enact supports several commands, each accessible through the `enact` command and through npm aliases in `package.json`. For help on individual commands, add `--help` following the command name. The commands are:

### `enact serve` (aliased as `npm run serve`)

Builds and serves the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `enact pack` (aliased as `npm run pack`, `npm run pack-p`, and `npm run watch`)

Builds the project in the working directory. Specifically, `pack` builds in development mode with code un-minified and with debug code included, whereas `pack-p` builds in production mode, with everything minified and optimized for performance. Be sure to avoid shipping or performance testing on development mode builds.

### `enact clean` (aliased as `npm run clean`)

Deletes previous build fragments from ./dist.

### `enact lint` (aliased as `npm run lint`)

Runs the Enact configuration of ESLint on the project for syntax analysis.

### `enact test` (aliased as `npm run test`, `npm run test-json`, and `npm run test-watch`)

These tasks will execute all valid tests (files that end in `-specs.js`) that are within the project directory. The `test` is a standard execution pass, `test-json` uses a json reporter for output, and `test-watch` will set up a watcher to re-execute tests when files change.

### `enact license` (aliased as `npm run license`)

Outputs a JSON representation of the licenses for modules referenced by the current project as well as any licenses of modules used by `@enact/cli` that may be included in a production build of an app.
